<h1> The History of Matcha </h1>
<h2> Origin </h2>
<p> Matcha originated in China during the Tang Dyanasty (7th-10th century). It became more commonly used during the Song dynasty as tea leaves turned into bricks for trade.
  A Japanese buddhist monk named Eisei brought the tea leaves back to Japan along with the Zen Buddhist way of preparing powdered tea to consume. During the Kamakura shogunate, matcha was seen as a status symbol as it was only produced in small quantities. </p>
